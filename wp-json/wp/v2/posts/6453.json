Here&#8217;s a rundown of several college degrees:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bachelor&#8217;s Degree<\/strong> The associate of arts (AA) or associate of science (AS) degree is a two-year program (AS). Some students who receive this degree continue on to a four-year bachelor&#8217;s program, while others use it to enter the workforce right away. Associate degrees are offered by community colleges, career institutions, and some four-year colleges.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bachelor of Arts<\/strong> (B.A.) A four- or five-year college program is required for this degree. The majority of students graduate with a bachelor of arts (BA) or a bachelor of science (BS) degree (BS). You can also get a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts or a bachelor&#8217;s degree in architecture.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-6456 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/03\/pexels-andrea-piacquadio-3884085-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"The Perfect Guide to Choosing a College Major\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" title=\"\"><\/p>\n<p>Joint Bachelor&#8217;s Degree When students combine a bachelor&#8217;s degree with a graduate or professional degree, they can complete both in less time. On this track, a student can apply to a graduate program as an undergraduate and start in their fourth year of college.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Master&#8217;s Degree<\/strong> Graduate degrees are those earned after completing a bachelor&#8217;s degree. A master of arts (MA) or a master of science (MS) are two examples (MS). After two years of study, students usually receive a master&#8217;s degree. A doctoral degree (such as a Ph.D.) takes four or more years to complete.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<section class=\"-mx-4 md:-mx-1\/2vw py-12 md:py-16 mt-12 md:my-16 relative md:left-1\/2 md:right-1\/2 md:w-screen bg-gray-50\">\n<div class=\"container content\">\n<h3 id=\"3-what-are-you-good-at\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_What_Are_You_Good_At\"><\/span><strong>3.
