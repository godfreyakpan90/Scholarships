It is also, branch of biology and medicine.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"_Toc75969810\"><\/a><strong>Brief about Anatomy:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The study of anatomy dates back more than 2,000 years Trusted Source, to the Ancient Greeks. There are three broad areas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We have the human anatomy<\/li>\n<li>animal anatomy \u2014 zootomy and<\/li>\n<li>plant anatomy which is known as phytotomy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Human anatomy is the study of the structures of the human body. A considerate of anatomy is key to the practice of medicine and other areas of health.<\/p>\n<p>The word \u201canatomy\u201d comes from the Greek words \u201cAna,\u201d meaning \u201cup,\u201d and \u201ctome,\u201d meaning \u201ca cutting.\u201d Traditionally, studies of anatomy have involved cutting up, or dissecting, organisms. Therefore<\/p>\n<p>Now, however, imaging technology can illustrate to us much about how the inside of a body works, reducing the need for categorization.<\/p>\n<p>Below, we have outlined the two main approaches: which is the <strong>microscopic anatomy<\/strong> and <strong>gross, or macroscopic, anatomy.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a name=\"_Toc75969811\"><\/a><strong>Gross anatomy<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>In medicine, gross, macro, or topographical anatomy is refers to the study of the biological structures that the eye can see. In other words, a person does not need a microscope to see these features.<\/p>\n<p>The study of gross anatomy may engage dissection or noninvasive methods. The aim is to collect information about the larger structures of organs and organ body systems.<\/p>\n<p>In dissection, a scientist cuts open an organism \u2014 a plant or the body of a human or another animal \u2014 and examines what they find out inside.<\/p>\n<p>Endoscopy is an instrument for diagnosing ill health, but it can also play a role in researchTrusted Source. It involves a scientist or doctor inserting a long, thin tube with a camera at the end into different parts of the body. By passing it from the mouth or rectum, for example, they can examine the inside of the gastrointestinal tract.<\/p>\n<p>There are also less invasive methods of research. For example, to study the blood vessels of life animals or humans, a scientist or doctor may inject an opaque dye, and then use the imaging technology, such as angiography, to see the vessels that restrain the dye. This reveals how the circulatory system is working and whether there are any blockages.<\/p>\n<p>MRI scans; CT scans, and PET scans, X-rays, ultrasounds, and other types of imaging can also show what is happening inside a living body.<\/p>\n<p>Medical and dental students also perform dissection as part of their practical work during their studies.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"_Toc75969812\"><\/a><strong>The Anatomy study of the Human Systems<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are 11 organ systems in the human body and, they are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0skeletal system<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0muscular system<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0lymphatic system<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0respiratory system<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0digestive system<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0nervous system, including the central and autonomic systems<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0endocrine system, which regulates hormone production<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0cardiovascular system, including the heart<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0urinary system<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0reproductive system<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0integumentary system, which includes the skin, hair, and nails, among other areas<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These systems outlined above functions almost together and they depend on each other as well.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"_Toc75969813\"><\/a><strong>The Microscopic anatomy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Definition of Microscopic anatomy, also known as histology: this is the study of cells and tissues of animals, humans, and plants. People learn about the structure of cells and how they relate to each other through the use microscope.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if a person has cancer, examining the tissue under the microscope will reveal how the cancerous cells are acting and how they affect healthy tissue.<\/p>\n<p>Researcher, apply the histological techniques such as sectioning and staining to tissues and cells. They may then observe them beneath an electron or a light microscope.<\/p>\n<p>Sectioning involves the cutting of tissue into very thin slices for close assessment.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of staining tissues and cells is to add or improve color. This makes it easier to classify the exact tissues under examination.<\/p>\n<p>Histology is vital for the understanding and progression of medicine, veterinary medicine, biology, and other aspects of life science.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Histology can be use in all the aspects listed below: <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Teaching<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In teaching labs, histology slides can help students learn about the microstructures of biological tissues.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Diagnosis<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Doctors take tissue samples, or biopsies, from people who may have cancer or other illnesses and send the samples to a lab, where a histologist can investigate them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Forensic investigations<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In a case where by a person dies suddenly, the microscopic study of exact biological tissues can be helpful to experts in discovering the cause of the death.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autopsies<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As in forensic investigations, experts study tissues from deceased people and animals to understand the causes of death.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Archeology<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This is for the Biological samples from archeological sites it can provide more useful information about what was happening thousands of years ago.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN ANATOMY<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Anatomy and physiology jobs with an associate degree<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medical laboratory technician Top of Form<\/li>\n<li>Physical therapist assistant<\/li>\n<li>Personal trainer<\/li>\n<li>Massage therapist<\/li>\n<li>Nurse<\/li>\n<li>MRI technologist<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Anatomy and physiology jobs with a bachelor&#8217;s degree<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Medical technologist<\/li>\n<li>Science teacher<\/li>\n<li>Biomedical engineer<\/li>\n<li>Research scientist<\/li>\n<li>Pharmacologist<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Anatomy and physiology careers with advanced degrees<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physical therapist<\/li>\n<li>Physician<\/li>\n<li>Anatomy professor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"mh-custom-posts-small-title\">See also&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<a title=\"Regina University Admission Requirements\" href=\"https:\/\/www.applyjobs.org.ng\/regina-university-admission-requirements\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Regina University Admission Requirements <\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Human Anatomy Research and career opportunities ,Brief about Anatomy,Gross anatomy,The Microscopic anatomy,The Study of Human Systems.
