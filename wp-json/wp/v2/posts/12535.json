It offers more than 200 undergraduate majors and programs, and its graduate schools offer more than 100 master\u2019s degrees and doctoral degrees.<\/p>\n<p>The state constitution of California envisioned a university that would &#8220;contribute even more than California&#8217;s gold to the glory and happiness of advancing generations,&#8221; which was the inspiration for Berkeley&#8217;s creation.<\/p>\n<p>In 1873, the colors gold and blue were chosen for Berkeley, with blue representing not only the sky and ocean of California but also the Yale graduates who helped establish the school; gold California is known as the &#8220;Golden State.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The university has approximately 27,000 undergraduate and 10,000 postgraduate students and is situated in the Bay Area of San Francisco.<\/p>\n<p>There have been 19 Nobel Prizes awarded to Berkeley faculty members, the majority of them in the fields of physics, chemistry, and economics. Saul Perlmutter, who led a team that discovered the accelerating expansion of the universe and suggested the existence of a form of dark energy that accounts for 75% of the universe, was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics. and George Akerlof, who was awarded the Prize for Economics in 2001 for demonstrating how markets fail when sellers and buyers have different access to information.<\/p>\n<p>Jack London, a novelist and journalist, Gregory Peck, an Oscar-winning actor, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a former Pakistani prime minister and president, Joan Didion, and Alex Morgan, a US footballer who won the Women&#8217;s World Cup, are among the notable alumni.<\/p>\n<p>Berkeley has a custom as a focal point of political activism. The campus was a hotbed of student protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s.<\/p>\n<p>The 1890-built Botanic Garden and the 60,000-seat California Memorial Stadium, which is where the university&#8217;s sports teams play, are among the campus attractions.<\/p>\n<p>The Berkeley sports teams are represented by the Golden Bear.<\/p>\n<p>Berkeley&#8217;s donning ability was exhibited at the 2012 Olympics in London, when its alumni won 17 awards &#8211; 11 gold, one silver and five bronze. Together with France and Germany, Berkeley would have ranked joint sixth in the gold medal table if it had been a nation.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"key-statistics-of-university-of-california-berkeley\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Key_Statistics_of_University_of_California_Berkeley\"><\/span>Key Statistics of University of California, Berkeley<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Percentage of International Students<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">24<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Number of Students per Staff<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">18.4<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Student Ratio of Females to Males<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">52 : 48<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Number of FTE Students<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">40,921<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">On-campus Room and Board<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">$19,105<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Salary after 10 years<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">$62,433<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Out-of-state Tuition and Fees<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\">$44,007<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h3 id=\"subjects-taught-at-university-of-california-berkeley\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Subjects_Taught_at_University_of_California_Berkeley\"><\/span>Subjects Taught at University of California, Berkeley<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Social sciences<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Communication &amp; Media Studies<\/li>\n<li>Geography<\/li>\n<li>Politics &amp; International Studies (incl Development Studies)<\/li>\n<li>Sociology<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Education<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Education<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Engineering &amp; technology<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Civil Engineering<\/li>\n<li>Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering<\/li>\n<li>Chemical Engineering<\/li>\n<li>Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering<\/li>\n<li>General Engineering<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Arts &amp; humanities<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Languages, Literature &amp; Linguistics<\/li>\n<li>History, Philosophy &amp; Theology<\/li>\n<li>Archaeology<\/li>\n<li>Architecture<\/li>\n<li>Art, Performing Arts &amp; Design<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Physical sciences<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Mathematics &amp; Statistics<\/li>\n<li>Physics &amp; Astronomy<\/li>\n<li>Geology, Environmental, Earth &amp; Marine Sciences<\/li>\n<li>Chemistry<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Life sciences<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Agriculture &amp; Forestry<\/li>\n<li>Biological Sciences<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Psychology<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Psychology<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Business &amp; economics<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Economics &amp; Econometrics<\/li>\n<li>Business &amp; Management<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Law<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Law<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Computer science<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Computer Science<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Clinical, pre-clinical &amp; health<\/strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Other Health<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2 id=\"university-of-michigan\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"University_of_Michigan\"><\/span>University of Michigan<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The University of Michigan has been ranked among the top ten universities in the world by QS World Rankings since 2013.
