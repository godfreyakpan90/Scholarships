However, here are a few justifications for joining Payoneer.<\/p>\n<p>1. $25 Bonus and Free Signup.<br \/>\nJoining Payoneer is completely free. Interestingly, if you receive a payment in the amount of $1000 (or the equivalent in another currency) from a verified business, you are eligible for a bonus of $25. Therefore, Payoneer is a good choice if you want to receive your funds in a timely manner.<\/p>\n<p>2. Free account in a foreign bank.<br \/>\nYou can get a local bank account in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom, and Japan with Payoneer. Simply share the Payoneer-provided bank account information (located under your Payoneer dashboard) when you need to receive payment. This means that you won&#8217;t have to worry about losing money on multiple currency exchanges.<\/p>\n<p>3. Free Mastercard for Payoneer.<br \/>\nWhen you join Payoneer, you are also entitled to a free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mastercard.com\/global\/en.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MasterCard<\/a>. You can withdraw money using this card at any ATM in the world. It can be used to pay at any point of sale. Payoneer charges $3 for each withdrawal you make at the ATM.<\/p>\n<p>4. You can withdraw cash anywhere.<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s interesting to note that Payoneer lets you withdraw funds in your home country&#8217;s currency. However, the Payoneer MasterCard&#8217;s daily withdrawal limit is set at a certain amount. You may be restricted to a daily withdrawal limit of GH400 for new users. The majority of UK users are set to have a daily withdrawal limit of 3,000 GH.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"what-you-need-to-do-to-open-a-payoneer-account-in-uk\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_you_need_to_do_to_open_a_Payoneer_Account_in_UK\"><\/span>What you need to do to open a Payoneer Account in UK<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There aren&#8217;t too many of the necessary details.
