Based on the principles of Florence Nightingale, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) established one of the first schools of nursing in 1873, the Boston Training School for Nurses, which later became the Massachusetts General Hospital Training School for Nurses in 1896, and later, the Massachusetts General Hospital School of Nursing.<\/p>\n<p>This diploma school was the oldest continually running school of nursing in the United States when it closed in 1981, and it was the forerunner to the MGH Institute\u2019s School of Nursing.<\/p>\n<p>The transition from hospital-based to college- and university-based health science education produced a number of challenges, including a lack of synergy between clinical and didactic parts of healthcare curricula.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>MGH Institute of Health Professions Programs<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Post-Professional Degrees (for RNs)<\/li>\n<li>Master of Science, Nursing (Post BSN) to become a nurse practitioner (NP)<\/li>\n<li>Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) (two tracks):<\/li>\n<li>DNP for Advanced Practice Nurses: Online<\/li>\n<li>DNP for Nurse Executives: Online<\/li>\n<li>Post-Professional Certificate Programs<\/li>\n<li>Post-NP \/ MSN Certificate of Advanced Study (Credentialed)<\/li>\n<li>Certificates of Completion<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conditions of Admission<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All students are admitted conditionally once they have been accepted, pending the completion of any outstanding entrance requirements.
