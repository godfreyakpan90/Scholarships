Medicine is the field of health and curative. It includes nurses, doctors, and a variety of specialists. It as well covers the analysis, cure, and avoidance of disease, medical investigation, and other numerous aspects of health.<\/p>\n<p>Medicine as well aims to promote and uphold health and wellbeing.<\/p>\n<p>Conventional modern medicine is sometimes called allopathic medicine. It involves the use of drugs or surgery, regularly supported by counseling and lifestyle dealings.<\/p>\n<p>An Alternative and corresponding types of medicine include <u>acupuncture<\/u>, homeopathy, herbal medicine, art therapy, traditional Chinese medicine, and several others.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fields of medicine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Modern medicine has many fields and aspects. Here are some of them outlined below;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a name=\"_Toc75871314\"><\/a> <strong>Clinical medicine( practice)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In the clinical aspect, we have a clinician<\/p>\n<p>Who is a Clinician? A clinician works with patients in a health setting.<\/p>\n<p>A clinician is a health worker who <u>works directly<\/u> with patients in a hospital or other healthcare setting. Nurses, doctors, psychotherapists, and other specialists are all clinicians.<\/p>\n<p>Not all medical specialists are clinicians. Researchers and laboratory personnel are not clinicians since they do not work with patients.<\/p>\n<p>The physician assesses the individual, with the aim of diagnosing, treating, and preventing sickness using the knowledge learned from training, investigations, and experiences, and medical finding.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a name=\"_Toc75871315\"><\/a> <strong>Biomedical medicine( Research)<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This area of science seeks ways to avoid and treat diseases that lead to ill health or death.<\/p>\n<p>Many Biomedical scientists use biotechnology techniques to study biological processes and diseases.

It involves biologists, chemists, doctors, pharmacologists, and others.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a name=\"_Toc75871316\"><\/a> <strong>Medications<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>This field is to look at drugs or medicines and how to use them.<\/p>\n<p>Doctors and other health professionals use medications in the medical diagnosis, treatment, cure, and prevention of disease.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a name=\"_Toc75871317\"><\/a> <strong>Surgery<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Surgical dealings are essential for diagnosing and treating some types of disease, malformation, and injury. They use instrumental and manual means rather than medication.<\/p>\n<p>Surgeons carry out a surgical procedure to get rid of or replace diseased tissue or organs, or they may use surgery to remove tissue for biopsy. Sometimes, they remove unnecessary tissue and then send it for diagnosis.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a name=\"_Toc75871318\"><\/a> <strong>Medical devices<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Health professionals use a wide range of instruments to diagnose and treat a disease or other condition, to prevent a worsening of symptoms, to replace a damaged part such as a hip or a knee, and so on. Note that Medical devices range from test tubes to sophisticated scanning machines.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"_Toc75871319\"><\/a><strong>Alternative and complementary medicine<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ayurveda is an ancient healing art and also a type of alternative medicine.<\/p>\n<p>This may include any performance that aims to heal but is not part of conventional medicine. Techniques range broadly. They include the use of herbs, manipulation of \u201cchannels\u201d in the body, relaxation, and so on.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please kindly take note of this;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2018Alternative and complementary\u2019 do not have the same meaning the difference is made known below:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Alternative medicine<\/strong>: People use a different option from the conventional one, such as using relaxation measures to improve <u>headaches<\/u>, rather than pain relief medication.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Complementary medicine<\/strong>: People add a different treatment option to the main treatment.
