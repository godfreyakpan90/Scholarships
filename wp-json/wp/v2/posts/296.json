The most popular immigration programs are:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Express Entry:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This program is designed for skilled workers who want to move to Canada permanently. It involves a points-based system that assesses the applicant&#8217;s age, education, work experience, language skills, and other factors to determine their eligibility. Successful candidates are then placed in a pool of applicants and invited to apply for permanent residency based on their score.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Provincial Nominee Program (PNP):<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This program allows Canadian provinces and territories to nominate immigrants who have the skills, education, and work experience needed to meet their specific labor market needs. Each province or territory has its own set of criteria for selecting candidates.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Family sponsorship:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Canadian citizens and permanent residents can sponsor their eligible family members, such as spouses, partners, children, parents, and grandparents, to come to Canada as permanent residents.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>Business and investor immigration:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">This program is designed for individuals who are looking to invest in or start a business in Canada. Applicants are required to have a minimum net worth and invest a certain amount of capital in a Canadian business.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to these programs, there are also several other options for permanent residency, including refugee and humanitarian programs, as well as the Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program, which targets skilled workers and international graduates in the Atlantic provinces.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2 id=\"permanent-residency-via-the-express-entry-system\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Permanent_Residency_via_the_Express_Entry_System\"><\/span>Permanent Residency via the Express Entry System<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The Express Entry system is an online points-based system that is one of the best options for immigrants seeking permanent residence in Canada. Express Entry is extremely versatile because it consists of three immigration programmes that cater to a wide range of needs.<\/p>\n<p>The Express Entry system covers the following programmes:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Canadian Experience Class<\/li>\n<li>Federal Skilled\u00a0Program<\/li>\n<li>Federal Skilled Trades Program (Federal Skilled Trades Program)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Regardless of which immigration programme you choose, we strongly advise you to double-check all programme requirements, correctly fill out forms, and submit all supporting documents with your Canada PR application. If you have a job offer in one of the provinces, you should make sure you can meet the job offer\u2019s criteria and conditions, if applicable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<h2 id=\"how-canadian-express-entry-sponsorship-program-works\" class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_Canadian_Express_Entry_Sponsorship_Program_Works\"><\/span>How Canadian Express Entry Sponsorship Program Works<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible\">Express Entry is a system used by the Canadian government to manage applications for permanent residency under certain economic immigration programs. Under the Express Entry system, eligible candidates are given a Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score based on factors such as age, education, work experience, language proficiency, and other factors. Candidates with the highest CRS scores are then invited to apply for permanent residency.<\/div>\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n<p>Express Entry Sponsorship also includes a category for spousal sponsorship called the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada (SCLPC) class. This category allows a Canadian citizen or permanent resident to sponsor their spouse or common-law partner who is already living with them in Canada to become a permanent resident.<\/p>\n<p>To be eligible for sponsorship under the SCLPC class, the sponsored spouse or partner must meet certain requirements, such as being legally married to the sponsor or having been in a common-law relationship for at least one year. The sponsoring individual must also meet certain requirements, such as demonstrating the ability to support their spouse or partner financially.<\/p>\n<p>If the sponsored spouse or partner is eligible to apply for permanent residency under one of the economic immigration programs managed through Express Entry, such as the Federal Skilled Worker Program or the Canadian Experience Class, then they can submit their application through Express Entry.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-permanent-residents-in-canada-resident-permit\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Benefits_of_Permanent_Residents_in_Canada_%E2%80%93_Resident_Permit\"><\/span><span id=\"Benefits_of_Permanent_Residents_in_Canada_-_Resident_Permit\" class=\"ez-toc-section\"><\/span>Benefits of Permanent Residents in Canada \u2013 Resident Permit<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As a permanent resident, you have the right to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Get most social benefits that Canadian citizens receive, including Health Care Coverage,<\/li>\n<li>live, work or study anywhere in Canada,<\/li>\n<li>Apply for\u00a0Canadian citizenship,<\/li>\n<li>Protection under Canadian law and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You must pay taxes and respect all Canadian laws at the federal, provincial and municipal levels.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to taking advantage of Canada PR\u2019s advantages, you must comprehend which PR pathways are offered and how the application procedure will operate.<\/p>\n<p>We will examine one of the most popular immigration routes below because of the speedy outcomes it generates: both the Provincial Nomination Program and the Express Entry System.<\/p>\n<p>Remember that despite the fact that there are over 100 immigration pathways and visas available in Canada, each applicant\u2019s situation and needs are taken into consideration when selecting a program.
