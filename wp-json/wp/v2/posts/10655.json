This scholarship is only available for master&#8217;s and doctoral programs. The Fulbright Foreign Student Program covers the entire cost of tuition, a living stipend, housing, airfare, and health insurance.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. government&#8217;s flagship international educational exchange program, these scholarships are sponsored by the Department of State. Through educational and cultural exchange, the goal is to foster international understanding. The applicants&#8217; race, color, national origin, sex, age, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity are not taken into consideration when awarding the grants.<\/p>\n<p>The Fulbright scholarship program aims to provide diverse groups with access to educational institutions in the United States. People from economically disadvantaged groups, minorities, and traditionally underrepresented backgrounds are eligible for the scholarships.<\/p>\n<p>Since 1946, thousands of foreign students from 155 nations have received Fulbright scholarships to attend universities and other educational establishments in the United States. The grant was started to help imaginative, youthful and skilled unfamiliar understudies to seek after their alumni review and lead a-list research in the US of America.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"fulbright-scholarship-coverage\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Fulbright_Scholarship_Coverage\"><\/span>Fulbright Scholarship Coverage<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Fulbright Scholarship 2024 is a fully funded scholarship and provides the recipient with the following benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The scholarship covers tuition, a living stipend, airfare and health insurance, etc. The Fulbright program provides funding for the duration of the study.<\/li>\n<li>See the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/foreign.fulbrightonline.org\/applicants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">official website<\/a>\u00a0and country specific websites for the complete list of scholarship benefits.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"fulbright-scholarship-summary\" dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Fulbright_Scholarship_Summary\"><\/span>Fulbright Scholarship Summary<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level of Study:<\/strong>\u00a0Masters, PhD<\/li>\n<li><strong>Institution(s):<\/strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/foreign.fulbrightonline.org\/host-institutions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">USA Universities and Academic Institutions<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Study in:<\/strong>\u00a0USA<\/li>\n<li><strong>Courses Offered:<\/strong>\u00a0All fields, including interdisciplinary courses.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Program Period:<\/strong>\u00a0Depends on the selected program.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Fulbright Scholarship Deadline:\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/foreign.fulbrightonline.org\/applicants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">Varies per countries<\/a>\u00a0(Feb. to Oct. annually)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 id=\"eligibility-criteria-fulbright-scholarship-2024\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Eligibility_Criteria_Fulbright_Scholarship_2024\"><\/span>Eligibility Criteria Fulbright Scholarship 2024<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>To be eligible for Fulbright Scholarship 2024, applicants must meet the following criteria:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Required Language:\u00a0<\/strong>English<\/li>\n<li><strong>Eligible Countries:<\/strong>\u00a0International students from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/foreign.fulbrightonline.org\/applicants\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">155 countries<\/a>\u00a0around the world.<\/li>\n<li>Program eligibility and selection procedures vary widely by country.<\/li>\n<li>Please see the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/foreign.fulbrightonline.org\/applicants\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">country specific websites<\/a>\u00a0to find information about the Fulbright Program in your home country, including eligibility requirements and application guidelines.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-apply-for-fulbright-scholarship-2024\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Apply_for_Fulbright_Scholarship_2024\"><\/span>How to Apply for Fulbright Scholarship 2024?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>(1) Fill out an online application<\/p>\n<p>Before applying to the Fulbright program, you must gather a number of materials that will assist the USEFP in evaluating your qualifications. Your application must include all materials.<\/p>\n<p>(2) Prepare Academic Transcripts and Degrees<\/p>\n<p>All transcripts and degrees from an undergraduate degree earned over a four-year period or its equivalent (equivalent programs include international three-year bachelor&#8217;s programs or ACCA). PhD applicants must also submit transcripts for their MPhil or MS degrees. If you earn your bachelor&#8217;s degree by December of this year, you can also apply while you are in your final year of undergraduate study.<\/p>\n<p>Not just your GPA, but also your transcripts are taken into account by the USEFP. They consider where you went for your schooling, the courses that you took and your presentation in individual courses. Additionally, they take into consideration the fact that distinct grading systems exist at various universities. Although the majority of successful Fulbright students have excellent undergraduate records, there is no minimum GPA requirement to apply. The Fulbright panel considers a number of factors when evaluating a candidate, including undergraduate academics.<\/p>\n<p>(3) Take the GRE General Test and the TOFEL<\/p>\n<p>When you submit your application, you can report either your official GRE score if you have it or your unofficial GRE score from the day of the test. Using the code 9388, every applicant must request that ETS send an official score report directly to USEFP. At the time of application, GRE general (international) test scores are required. A good GRE score in engineering and sciences is at least 315, while a good score in other fields is at least 310. The subject test for the GRE is optional.<\/p>\n<p>The minimum GRE scores for the Fulbright program are 138 for the verbal section and 136 for the quantitative section. However, in most cases, applicants who are accepted have a GRE score in the upper percentiles. You may report your highest GRE score if you take it multiple times, and Fulbright will only consider that score. At the time of application, the TOEFL is not required. If you are invited for an interview, you will be required to take the TOEFL test. IELTS should not be used.<\/p>\n<p>(4) Prepare Two Essays<\/p>\n<p>The Fulbright application requires two essays. Each essay must be written in the approximately 800-word space provided on the application. Avoid overwriting in your essays; Just write clearly so that the Fulbright panel, which doesn&#8217;t know much about your world, can better understand you. You will need to devise a personal marketing strategy before beginning the essays. The essays of successful applicants typically take 4-6 weeks to write and perfect.<\/p>\n<p>(5) Three letters of recommendation are required.<\/p>\n<p>By the application deadline, you must include three letters of recommendation with your application. You can have three letters of reference from academic institutions, or you can have two professional letters and one academic letter. That is to say, only one academic reference letter is required. The reference forms included in the application package must be completed by your referees, who must then sign, stamp, and seal them in an envelope. When you present your internet based application your officials will be emailed a web-based structure.<\/p>\n<p>The question of &#8220;who should write your references&#8221; is open to interpretation. Because USEFP does not want to put your current position at risk during the application process, it is sometimes not possible to ask your employer to write your recommendation. Simply locate individuals who are familiar with you enough to respond. It could be a teacher, researcher, or former employer.<\/p>\n<p>(6) Create Academic Resume<\/p>\n<p>Fill the space on the application form with a resume that is up-to-date and current. It doesn&#8217;t have to be in a particular format for you. Please read this helpful article on how to create a scholarship-winning academic CV (resume).<\/p>\n<p>(7) Submit an Online Application<\/p>\n<p>The Fulbright program does not charge an application fee. Online applications are required.<\/p>\n<p>(8) Interview<\/p>\n<p>Following review of your written application, you may be invited to a panel interview. Decisions regarding interviews are made by the middle of September, and interviews are held in October. If you don&#8217;t hear back from USEFP by October, it means that you weren&#8217;t chosen. Although the interview is a good sign, it does not guarantee admission. A panel of four people conduct 15 to 30 minute interviews. On the day of the interview, you must bring your TOEFL registration slip, but you are not required to have taken the test by the date of the interview.<\/p>\n<p>To Apply, visit the US Embassy of your country.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/foreign.fulbrightonline.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to go the main Website<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"This is a rare chance for you to take advantage of if you want to study in the&hellip;\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":10657,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[14],"tags":[655],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10655"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=10655"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10655\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=10655"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=10655"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=10655"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
