Learning a new language is difficult enough, but if the language you choose is already deemed complex and difficult, you&#8217;re in for a tremendous mental test! While Mandarin is widely regarded as one of the most difficult languages in the world, there are several other competitors on the list that are frequently overlooked! For language enthusiasts who are continually hurrying to pick a new intriguing language, we have produced a list of the ten most challenging languages in this blog.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"1-mandarin\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_Mandarin\"><\/span><strong>1.

The language, which is spoken by over a billion people worldwide, can be incredibly difficult for those whose native languages employ the Latin writing system. The fact that Mandarin is a tonal language with hundreds of characters and a strange writing system makes it difficult to learn. Because Mandarin is not a phonetic language, memorizing and writing the words might be difficult. In China, simply searching up Chinese words in a dictionary is considered a skill, which should indicate how difficult the language is!<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Top 20 Most Difficult Languages to Learn\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/7wAH8BNbXig?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"2-arabic\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"_2_Arabic\"><\/span>\u00a0<strong>2.

According to the Foreign Services Institute, learning Arabic can take up to two years.
