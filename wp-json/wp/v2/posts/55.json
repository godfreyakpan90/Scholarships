The sponsor must be at least 18 years old, meet specific income requirements, and be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident living in Canada.<\/p>\n<p>The foreign national must also meet eligibility requirements, such as language proficiency, education, and work experience. The sponsorship process can be lengthy and complex, and it is recommended to seek the assistance of an experienced immigration lawyer or consultant.
