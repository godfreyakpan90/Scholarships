Fix Failed to Load Media by Updating Chrome<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>An out-of-date browser frequently causes the problem at hand. Therefore, if you keep the Chrome auto-update setting disabled, it might be time to turn it on and manually update your browser.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are not sure if your browser is up to date, click on the three vertical lines in the upper right corner of Chrome. Help install Google Chrome in Chrome.<\/li>\n<li>Go to Help; About Chrome.<\/li>\n<li>Allow Chrome auto-updates to avoid experiencing the same problem again. If Chrome is already up to date, you will receive a notice that says, &#8220;Chrome is up to date.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>The notification verifies that outdated Chrome was not the source of the problem.

Enable or Disable VPN<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A VPN protects your privacy, but it can sometimes affect your online experience. So if you are accessing the video while your VPN browser is open, disable the VPN. This patch also works in reverse so you can watch the video if you haven&#8217;t used it.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, access to specific media links is restricted from certain locations. Using a VPN connection will remove this possibility. When turning off or enabling the VPN doesn&#8217;t solve the problem, it&#8217;s time to clear the browsing cache and history.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"7-clear-your-browser-cache-and-history\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7_Clear_your_Browser_Cache_and_History\"><\/span>7. Clear your Browser Cache and History<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Cached data makes web pages load faster by saving some content on the site from previous visits. However, it accumulates when it is not controlled and affects the browsing performance negatively. Therefore, it is important to clear the cache to prevent cache entry. To clear Chrome&#8217;s cache and history, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Press Ctrl + H to open Chrome&#8217;s history page.<\/li>\n<li>Click Clear Browsing Data on the left sidebar.<\/li>\n<li>View browsing history, cookies and other site data as well as saved images and files.<\/li>\n<li>Tap the Clear data button<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In a similar way, you can clear history in other browsers. Try again accessing the video on the webpage after clearing it. Is the error still present?<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"8-check-for-profile-explicit-issues\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"8_Check_for_Profile-Explicit_Issues\"><\/span>8. Check for Profile-Explicit Issues.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The issue may be unique to your browser profile in some instances. Try playing the video in an anonymous window to rule it out.<\/p>\n<p>To open an Incognito window, select New Incognito window by clicking the three vertical dots in Chrome&#8217;s upper-right corner. After that, play the video on the same website.<\/p>\n<p>Opening the New Undercover Windows in Chrome.<br \/>\nIf the video plays correctly this time, the issue is profile-specific, this suggests. Therefore, play the video once more and sign in with a different profile on your browser.<\/p>\n<p>You should delete your old profile and permanently switch to the new one if there are no errors on the new one. However, if using an Incognito window or switching profiles does not help, apply the following fix.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"9-disable-extensions-for-ad-blockers\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"9_Disable_Extensions_for_Ad_Blockers\"><\/span>9. Disable Extensions for Ad Blockers.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>By directly interfering with the script of the website, ad-blocker extensions prevent advertisements from appearing on that site. This interference can also prevent HTML tags like the video&gt; tag from running or cause some website content to not load correctly, resulting in the error we&#8217;re talking about. Disabling such extensions for a short period of time might help fix the issue.<\/p>\n<p>Follow these steps to disable an ad-blocker extension:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the upper-right corner, click on the three vertical dots.<\/li>\n<li>Select Extensions under More tools.<\/li>\n<li>In the installed extensions, look for the ad-blocker extensions.<\/li>\n<li>To remove the extension from Chrome, click Remove or use the toggle to disable it.<\/li>\n<li>Chrome&#8217;s Adblocker Extension Disabling or Removing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are a few additional options you can try if disabling ad-blocker extensions does not resolve the issue.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"10-you-can-save-the-video\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"10_You_can_save_the_Video\"><\/span>10. You can save the Video.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Consider downloading the video you&#8217;re having trouble playing if none of the solutions have worked for you. Users can download videos from websites with many video downloaders. Try downloading the video by selecting one of them.<\/p>\n<p>After downloading the video, you can watch it with this alternative. However, you should address the underlying issue if you want to avoid downloading videos each time you want to watch an embedded video. Continue implementing the remaining fixes in order to accomplish that.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"11-refresh-chrome\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"11_Refresh_Chrome\"><\/span>11. Refresh Chrome.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s best to reset Chrome if none of the aforementioned solutions work. It will undo any changes you&#8217;ve made to the settings up to this point, so it&#8217;s unlikely that customizing them is to blame for the issue. However, it will undo all of your customizations, necessitating a new configuration of the browser. Know about that gamble before you reset it.<\/p>\n<p>Follow these instructions to reset Chrome:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the upper-right corner, click on the three vertical dots.<\/li>\n<li>Select Settings.<\/li>\n<li>Click the Advanced drop-down menu in the left sidebar.<\/li>\n<li>Select the button labeled &#8220;Reset and clean up.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Select Restore settings to their previous state.<\/li>\n<li>After that, select Reset settings.<\/li>\n<li>In Chrome Settings, resetting the browser.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a last resort, you might want to try reinstalling the browser from scratch if the reset method does not work.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"12-install-chrome-again\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"12_Install_Chrome_again\"><\/span>12. Install Chrome again.<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Reinstalling the browser will eliminate the possibility of restrictions on both the browser and the operating system side, despite the fact that resetting it will give it a fresh start. However, properly uninstall it first before doing that.<\/p>\n<p>To remove Chrome from Windows, perform the following steps:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open the app for Windows Settings.<\/li>\n<li>Go to the Applications section.<\/li>\n<li>In the search box in the Apps &amp; features settings, type &#8220;Chrome.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>Select Uninstall by clicking on it.<\/li>\n<li>Uninstalling Chrome in Windows&#8217;s Apps Settings.<\/li>\n<li>Chrome can be uninstalled in a similar manner but with slightly different steps on macOS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Grab a new copy of Chrome and reinstall it after you&#8217;ve uninstalled it. Most likely, the issue will be fixed and the performance of your browser as a whole will improve after a new installation.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"still-having-trouble-resolving-the-error\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Still_having_trouble_resolving_the_error\"><\/span>Still having trouble resolving the error?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>With these fixes, I hope you can watch the video you were trying to play and resolve the browser issue. As a last resort, you might want to try switching to another browser if none of the troubleshooting steps helped. If the video on the website works fine in another browser, you might want to permanently switch from Chrome.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>Please like and share this content if you&#8217;ve benefitted from it. <a href=\"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/contact\/\">contact us<\/a> too if you encounter any issue.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Encountering the &#8220;Failed to Load Media&#8221; error in Chrome can be frustrating, but there are ways to fix&hellip;\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":315,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[27],"tags":[30],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/308"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=308"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/308\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/315"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=308"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=308"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/applyjobs.org.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=308"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
