Many jobs in Canada, such as live-in caregiving and farm jobs, do not require a work permit. As a foreign worker, you can switch employers or leave Canada without affecting your visa.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"who-can-get-a-working-visa\" dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Who_Can_Get_A_Working_Visa\"><\/span>Who Can Get A Working Visa?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Skilled tradespeople, semi-skilled workers, and those in low-skilled positions who have secured job offers from Canadian employers can apply for a work visa through direct and stress-free application process. The work permits are also quickly awarded.<\/p>\n<p>To be eligible to apply, applicants must meet certain conditions, including being offered full-time employment with a wage rate of at least C$24 per hour or C$18 per hour.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"sponsorship-opportunities-without-a-job-offer\" dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Sponsorship_Opportunities_Without_A_Job_Offer\"><\/span>Sponsorship Opportunities Without A Job Offer<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can get a work visa without being sponsored by an employer. If you can prove that you\u2019re financially buoyant and that you\u2019re not going to depend on any government agency or other institutions, you\u2019re eligible for a self-sponsorship visa.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be eligible, your net worth should be around $10,000 CAD, and you must have $2,000 CAD in your bank account.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-get-a-short-term-work-6-months-to-5-years\" dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_To_Get_A_Short-term_Work_6_Months_to_5_Years\"><\/span>How To Get A\u00a0Short-term Work (6 Months to 5 Years)<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Interested in working in Canada without a skilled job offer?

To be eligible, your employer must provide information about their business and explain why they cannot find Canadian workers to fill the positions.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"you-can-move-at-any-time\" dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"You_Can_Move_At_Any_Time\"><\/span>You Can Move At Any Time!<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Canadians have access to a wide range of visas and permits, which provides them with a lot of flexibility when it comes to job searching. If you are currently working as a caregiver, domestic helper, or chef, you are eligible to apply for an open work permit.<\/p>\n<p>An open work permit allows you to search for another full-time or part-time position with any employer who wishes to hire you, without having to reapply through an embassy or consulate abroad. While some occupations may require more specific documentation than others, work permits do not have quotas like visas and permanent residency options.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, it is possible to apply for unskilled jobs with visa sponsorship in Canada by following the tips mentioned above. With this knowledge, you can take the necessary steps to secure a job in Canada.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Planning to relocate to Canada?
