Our average acceptance criterion is 70% combined with the average of your university-prep Grade of 12 courses. Though, if your average is less than this level, we will give you a chance to demonstrate to us why your experience at SSU might be extra academically successful than your high school marks might suggest. This can be verified in one or more of the following ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A reference from a teacher or academic basis that would conform to the sensible hope for your capability to complete a degree.<\/li>\n<li>A written clarification by you, why your high school grades are low (e.g. family circumstances or behavioral issues), and why there would be an excellent expectation for academic achievement at SSU.<\/li>\n<li>A report describing an applicable learning disability as well as a duplicate of an official consideration or plans to acquire one.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Academic Success Plan<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Depending on circumstances and grades, you may be accepted on the basis of setting up a plan for academic success. This typically includes a partnership with an academic mentor to help ensure that everyone is prepared from the beginning to help you succeed in your transition to university studies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Homeschooling &amp; Mature Students | St Steven&#8217;s University Application<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A high school diploma is our average requirement for admissions. We warmly welcome applications from homeschoolers and mature students and will assess these applications on a case-by-case basis.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ESL Requirements<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>International students whose primary language is not English must demonstrate proficiency in English by scoring 550 on a paper-based TOEFL, 105 on a Duolingo English Test, 86 on an internet-based TOEFL, or 6.5 on an IELTS exam. Alternating language proficiency testing may be received based on the verified equivalency. Admissions staff on rare occasions may waive testing based on clearly demonstrated English fluency in the application method and an oral interview.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"ib-program-transfer-credits\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"IB_Program_Transfer_Credits\"><\/span>IB Program Transfer Credits<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>We offer transfer credits for students in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IB).
