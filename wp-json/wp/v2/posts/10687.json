In fact, teaching has been documented since 1096.<\/p>\n<p>The Oxford alumni list reads like a &#8220;who&#8217;s who&#8221; of famous people from around the world, as you might expect. Stephen Hawking, J.R.R. Tolkien, Malala Yousafzai, and numerous others are included in this. Oxford finally overtook Cambridge for the top spot last year, and it has remained here in the 2024 league table. However, admission to Oxford does not guarantee a top-notch degree. When one student tried to sue the university for \u00a31 million because he didn&#8217;t get a first, he discovered this for himself.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"2-university-of-cambridge\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"2_University_of_Cambridge\"><\/span><strong>2. University of Cambridge<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The University of Cambridge is the second-oldest university in the UK, established in 1209. As you probably already know, Cambridge has a lot of famous alumni, like Stephen Fry, David Mitchell, Richard Ayoade, Thandiwe Newton, and others.<\/p>\n<p>Cambridge consistently ranks among the top two UK universities in league tables. It dropped from first to second place last year, but it had been first for ten years in a row before.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to argue that the top spot wasn&#8217;t well-deserved given that they&#8217;ve already hired a Professor of Lego!<\/p>\n<p>Also, don&#8217;t be put off by Cambridge&#8217;s prestigious reputation. Take inspiration from our interview with YouTuber Ibz Mo, who broke boundaries at Cambridge, if you&#8217;re not sure if it&#8217;s for you.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"3-london-school-of-economics-and-political-science-lse\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"3_London_School_of_Economics_and_Political_Science_LSE\"><\/span><strong>3.

And this year, it&#8217;s third, taking London&#8217;s top spot.<\/p>\n<p>The list of famous university alums is also pretty impressive. It has hosted people like Sir David Attenborough and Mick Jagger. Additionally, former Prime Minister Clement Attlee taught there.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"4-university-of-st-andrews\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"4_University_of_St_Andrews\"><\/span><strong>4. University of St Andrews<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The oldest university in Scotland is St. Andrews, founded in 1413.<\/p>\n<p>You may be aware that Prince William and Kate Middleton, who met while attending the school, are among the St. Andrew&#8217;s alumni.<\/p>\n<p>Every year, the university is ranked among the best in the nation. Notwithstanding, it truly appears to succeed in Understudy Fulfillment &#8211; St Andrews is top in the UK with a score of 85%.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"5-imperial-college-london\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"5_Imperial_College_London\"><\/span><strong>5. Imperial College London<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Originally a part of the University of London, Imperial College London gained its independence in 2007. With a focus on science, engineering, business, and medicine, Imperial has ranked among the top five universities in the UK for the past seven years.<\/p>\n<p>The author H.G. Wells and Queen guitarist Brian May, who studied astrophysics at the university, are among its alumni. The university has approximately 18,000 students.<\/p>\n<p>Imperial&#8217;s Graduate Prospects rank second in the United Kingdom with a score of 92 percent. In this way, your possibilities getting a new line of work when you graduate are surprisingly better than at Oxford or Cambridge!<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"6-durham-university\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"6_Durham_University\"><\/span><strong>6. Durham University<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>After Oxford and Cambridge, Durham University was the first university to open in England in over 600 years when it was established in 1832. It consistently ranks among the UK&#8217;s best universities and has one of the highest proportions of students with private educations.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, Durham is home to a number of notable former students. Ed Gamble and Nish Kumar, comedians, and former Bond actor Roger Moore round out the list.<\/p>\n<p>According to CUG, Durham has excellent scores for Graduate Prospects and Degree Completion. Be that as it may, it tumbles down somewhat on its Understudy Fulfillment rating.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"7-loughborough-university\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"7_Loughborough_University\"><\/span><strong>7. Loughborough University<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>For the seventh year running, Loughborough University ranks in the top 10 in the United Kingdom.<\/p>\n<p>The university, which is best known for its love of athletics and served as Team GB&#8217;s headquarters during the London Olympics, ranks highly in part due to its excellent engineering and art and design departments.<\/p>\n<p>Loughborough puts a great deal of accentuation on understudies graduating with an inside and out range of abilities. As a result, it gives all undergraduate students the chance to earn a degree by working for a year in industry.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"8-university-of-bath\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"8_University_of_Bath\"><\/span><strong>8.

For the fourth year in a row, it is currently ranked in the top 10.<\/p>\n<p>The university ranks among the top 10 overall in terms of graduate prospects. Naturally, Bath, a stunning World Heritage Site, serves as its headquarters.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that a slew of successful athletes, including a slew of Olympic medalists, studied at Bath, even though many of the school&#8217;s graduates may not be familiar to you.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"9-university-college-london-ucl\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"9_University_College_London_UCL\"><\/span><strong>9.

It ranks highly in the league table&#8217;s more academic categories, like Research Quality and Entry Standards.<\/p>\n<p>However, UCL has a long history of leading the way. It was the first university to accept students of any race, social class, or religion and to treat women and men equally.<\/p>\n<p>Jonathan Ross, Chris Martin of Coldplay, and Alexander Graham Bell, the telephone&#8217;s inventor, are just a few of its notable alumni.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"10-university-of-warwick\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"10_University_of_Warwick\"><\/span><strong>10.
